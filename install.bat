@echo off
REM Z-Image Base UI one-click installer for Windows.
REM
REM Python is INCLUDED in this package, in the python_embeded folder,
REM Python 3.12, ComfyUI portable style. There is nothing to install
REM first, no venv is created, and no Python on your system is
REM touched or needed -- if you have no Python at all, this still
REM works.
REM
REM What it does:
REM   1. Bootstraps pip into the bundled Python, first run only,
REM      using the bundled get-pip.py.
REM   2. Installs PyTorch with CUDA support from the cu130 index,
REM      then the rest of the requirements -- Diffusers 0.42, Gradio,
REM      and the rest -- into python_embeded\Lib\site-packages.
REM   3. Creates images_out\ for finished pictures.
REM
REM What it does NOT do:
REM   - Touch any Python you already have. This app lives entirely
REM     in this folder and uses only the bundled Python 3.12.
REM     Your other apps keep using whatever Python they already use.
REM   - Download the Z-Image Base model weights. Diffusers downloads
REM     the model, about 15 GB on the default quantized path, from
REM     Hugging Face on the first Generate, into the Hugging Face
REM     cache on your user profile -- not into this folder.
REM   - Ask for any account, token, or license acceptance. Z-Image
REM     Base is Apache 2.0 and ungated: the first download just
REM     works, see README.md.
REM
REM Requirements: Windows, an NVIDIA GPU, 12 GB is plenty -- the
REM app defaults to a quantized transformer plus CPU offload, which
REM is what makes it fit, about 20 GB free disk for the first
REM download plus room for pictures.
